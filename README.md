# ITSupportTool
Swiss army knife which is a GUI in front of frequently used Powershell tools.

The idea is that you have one tool which does it all: query AD group memberships, add in bulk, connect to computer, see software, see what software is deployed to it via Intune, MECM. That without needing to leave the console.
Since it is Powershell based any action can be added.

Note that this is a vastly slimmed down version (meant to share as Open Source) of a production version. Many production feature versions should be build into this free version (f.e. VMWare Horizon, Azure Virtual Desktop etc)
