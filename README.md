# ITSupportTool
Swiss army knife which is a GUI in front of frequently used Powershell scripts.

The idea is that you have one tool which does it all: query AD group memberships, add in bulk, connect to computer, see software, see what software is deployed to it via Intune/MECM, run a health check to it etc,etc. That without needing to leave the console, you just hop from tab to tab.

Note that this version is a vastly slimmed down version (meant to share as Open Source) of a production version. Many production features should be build into this free version (f.e. VMWare Horizon, Azure Virtual Desktop)
